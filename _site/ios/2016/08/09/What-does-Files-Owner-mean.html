    <h3 id="what-is-files-owner-">1. What is “File’s Owner” ?</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code>, the owner of a file, that is the direct meaning of the words. Every xib file in Xcode has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code>. Most of the time,we just ignore the settings, and it works well. That is why we did not pay enough attention to it. When there is an error occured, we do not know what is happening and why.</p>

<h5 id="an-error-possibly-caused-by-files-owner">An error possibly caused by <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code>:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/files-owner/files-owner-issue.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We searched the possible reasons associated with this error, and found most of the results are about <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code>, so we checked the codes and the settings in xib file and found:</p>

<h5 id="the-codes-in-xcode">The codes in Xcode:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/files-owner/files-owner-issue-create-from-nib.png" alt="" /></p>

<h5 id="the-settings-of-files-owner-in-xib-file">The settings of <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> in xib file:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/files-owner/files-owner-issue-nib-setting.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><br />
The method <code class="highlighter-rouge">loadNibNamed:owner:options</code> will unarchive the contents of a nib file in the bundle and return an array containing the top-level objects in the nib file. All the objects in the array are instantiated when the nib file is unarchived. But the objects do NOT contain references to <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> object or any proxy objects.
<br />
Now, Let’s pay more attention to the param <code class="highlighter-rouge">owner</code>, the owner here means <em>The object to assign as the nib’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> object</em>. What is that? I can not understand the meaning of <em>nib’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> object</em>. Can the object be the Class bound with the nib file? Just the same as the class of the current view? I don’t know …</p>

<p>So,I begin to dig deeper to find what <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> really is and what exactly it can do.</p>

<h3 id="files-owner-in-apples-document">2. File’s Owner in Apple’s document</h3>

<p>I checked the documents of <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> in Apple official document, and here is the screenshot:</p>

<h5 id="files-owner-in-apple-official-documents">File’s Owner in Apple official documents:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/files-owner/apples-files-owner.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can see that <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> object is one of the most important objects in a nib file, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> is a placeholder object, and is NOT created when the nib file is loaded. <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> object must be created by yourself and you need to pass it to the nib-loading code to recreate the link of the code and the contents of a nib file. We can tell the <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> object can be <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSObject</code> in the Xcode and when you link your UI elements with your code (most of the time it is the ViewController class), the <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> object is specified (and it is your ViewController instance).</p>

<h3 id="what-does-files-owner-do-in-xib">3. What does “File’s Owner” do in XIB?</h3>

<p>From Apple’s official documents we know <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> object plays a role of ‘port’ between your UI elements in xib file and the codes which you designed to control the UI elements. When the xib file is loaded by methods like <code class="highlighter-rouge">loadNibNamed:owner:options</code>, we should pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> object to these methods, and these methods will recreate the connections you designed in <em>Interface Builder</em>. After the connections are established, your objects in the codes can reference the UI elements object in the xib file and you can control the UI elements through your codes.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-we-do-using-files-owner-">4. What should we do using “File’s Owner” ?</h3>

<p>So far as we know, We just leave the value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSObject</code> in the settings of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Identity Inspector</code> in Xcode, when the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Referencing Outlets</code> connections are established the <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> is automatically specified.</p>

<h5 id="the-default-value-of-files-owner-in-xcode">The default value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">File's Owner</code> in Xcode:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/files-owner/files-owner-issue-nib-setting.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/files-owner/files-owner-issue-nib-setting-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

  <p>The best help documents are Apple’s official programming guide, if we really read them earnestly, we will not get stuck so much.</p>
